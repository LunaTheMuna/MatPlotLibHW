Observations
1. There's a clear inverse relationship between number of drivers and average fare. Rural areas have fewer drivers and higher fares
2. What's not clear is how much of #1 is a factor of the number of drivers or the distance of the rides. Since we dont have the data on the latter, we cannot tell whether one or both are a factor but it's likely both are.
Despite the lower fares, it still pays to drive in the urban areas to increase total rides*fares
